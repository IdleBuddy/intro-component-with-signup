## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile Workflow First
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

Having to start this project over multiple times, I've learned how to properly use flexbox so it grows and shrinks in a responsive way without completely destroying the structure of the page. As well as how to properly grab element and write a simple javascript validation

### Continued development

Learn more about validation processes and make a functional sign up page.
